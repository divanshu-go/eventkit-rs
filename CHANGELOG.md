## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **MCP Server** — added `auth_status` and `request_access` tools, tools to set due timezone, geofence, and event availability, and embedded `Info.plist` to trigger macOS TCC privacy prompts.
- **EventKit Core** — exposed `URL`, `availability`, `structured_location`, `due_date_timezone`, and `attachments_count`, and added support for raw reflection via `dump_reminder_raw` and `dump_reminder_private`.
- **Testing** — added live EventKit tests and MCP smoke tests.

### Changed
- **Dependencies** — updated to support RMCP 1.4.
- **EventKit Core** — refactored creation and updates to use `Draft` and `Patch` structs.
- **Error messages** — enhanced authorization error messages with TCC remediation steps.
- **CI & Infrastructure** — migrated testing from `cargo test` to `cargo nextest`.

### Changed
- **Dependencies** — bumped `rmcp` to v1.4 and refactored the codebase to accommodate new macro and async transport usage.
- **Documentation** — refreshed project documentation in `README.md`.

### Added
- **PR description workflow** — introduced a new GitHub Actions workflow to automatically update PR descriptions on open and edit events.

### Changed
- **Cross-platform compilation** — moved `objc2`/`EventKit` dependencies behind `cfg(target_os = "macos")` and split source into platform-gated modules so the crate compiles as an empty shell on non-macOS platforms.
- **Dependencies** — updated `tokio` to 1.51, bumped `rmcp` to 1.3 for the latest MCP protocol features, and updated Cargo lockfile.
- **Project cleanup** — reorganized `Cargo.toml` metadata and features, replaced explicit closures with function pointers, and added clippy annotations for better maintainability.
- **Tracing logs** — implemented lighter logging for tracing.
- **CI/CD workflows** — updated the workflow strategy for universal builds.

### Fixed
- **Schema generation** — resolved stderr noise during schema generation by explicitly mapping Rust types (`usize`, `u8`) to standard schemars types.
- **CI/CD workflows** — fixed GitHub Actions workflow and release job yaml configurations.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-02-10

### Added

- **MCP Server**: Built-in Model Context Protocol (MCP) server via `--mcp` flag
  - Exposes all Calendar and Reminders functionality as MCP tools
  - Runs over stdio transport for easy integration with AI assistants
  - Gated behind the `mcp` feature (enabled by default)
- `mcp` module with `EventKitServer` and `run_mcp_server()` public API

### Changed

- `mcp` feature is now included in default features (`events`, `reminders`, `mcp`)
- CLI `command` field is now optional to support the top-level `--mcp` flag

### Fixed

- Event save/remove operations now use the explicit `commit: true` variants
  - `saveEvent:span:error:` replaced with `saveEvent:span:commit:error:` (commit = true)
  - `removeEvent:span:error:` replaced with `removeEvent:span:commit:error:` (commit = true)
  - Ensures events are committed to the Calendar database immediately, consistent with how reminders and calendars were already handled

  - Create, read, update, delete reminders
